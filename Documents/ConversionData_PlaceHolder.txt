The preferred type of file for use is the popular ".json" file (Read up on the file type here: http://www.json.org/). This format is chosen because it is easily machine readable which makes it easy to work with in data analytics. Other information for JSON is available from: http://www.w3schools.com/json/json_intro.asp and 

Json Schema:
The JSON schema is how the data is set up within the JSON document. It also sets up whether the data is required or optional to include within the document.

Helpful Ideas:
The JSON file format is needed to ensure that data analytics can happen properly. A ton of files cannot be natively converted to JSON and could require a custom tool. Thankfully a list of languages that have supporting JSON libraries is available on the JSON website and can be found by scrolling below the tutorial graphics on the main site. There are many libraries created to convert a single file to a JSON object.
