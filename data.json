The government is closing 40% of agency-identified, non­core data centers, while optimizing agency-identified core-data centers, according to a series of total cost of ownership metrics (see OMB M-13-09 and OMB M-14-08). This dataset reflects information only for agency-identified, non-core closures. All questions or inquiries should be directed to the specific agencies.
